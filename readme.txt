Spanish classical guitar
------------------------

Version 2019-06-18

Sound samples recorded from a Spanish classical guitar on 2008. Created by
roberto@zenvoid.org for the FreePats project.

Recorded with an AKG Perception 120 microphone and processed using free
software tools. The recording conditions were far from ideal, so several
filters have been applied to reduce noise and improve sound.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages:
